# reproducibility-motivation

Repeatable analysis can be repeated exactly with the identical outcome.

Reproducible can be reproduced with compatible results, but not necessarily with an identical workflow.

Every repeatable workflow is reproducible, but the opposite is not necessarily true.

Reproducible analysis implies existence of objective (or at least common, shared) knowledge, which can be reached with different paths. In this sense, general reproducibility is more valuable but more vague than simple repeatablility. 

Use of results of non-repeatable analyses implies strong trust in coherence of the analysis provider.

Repeatable analyses can be often easily adopted to ensure reproducibility. For example in ODA, substituting OSA version yields a new analysis, reproducing (or not) the original result.

Therefore, reproducibility strongly benefits from ensuring that every reproducing analysis path is repeatable.
